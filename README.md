# 2processmodel
 Little scripts to make a 2-process model plot.

 Running "ExamplePlot.m" will recreate [the classic figure](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275524207_Vulnerability_to_Sleep_Deprivation_A_Drift_Diffusion_Model_Perspective).

 But you can make your own figure however you want.

The function `plot2process()` lets you plot each element of the figure separately, so just assemble all the elements you want!
